# Image-gallery
Hello! I created an image gallery project using HTML and CSS, where I learned and applied concepts such as flexbox for layout, hover effects, filters, and drop shadows. This project showcases a selection of images with a clean and responsive design, enhanced by interactive visual effects. I felt a great sense of accomplishment and excitement as I saw my skills improve and the gallery come to life with each new feature I implemented.
